When I look through the viewfinder of my camera, the world seems to stand still, reduced to contrasts, shapes and plays of light. It is an art of omission, in which the absence of color creates space for the essential.

Each picture that slowly takes shape during development is like a small miracle. The process is haptic, tangible, almost meditative. 
It is a journey that not only teaches me to capture moments, but also to really see them - deeply and consciously.
